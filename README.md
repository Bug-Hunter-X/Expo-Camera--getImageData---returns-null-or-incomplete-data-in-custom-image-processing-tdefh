# Expo Camera: getImageData() Returns Null or Incomplete Data

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using Expo's Camera component with custom image processing. The issue involves `getImageData()` returning null or incomplete data, causing unexpected errors or crashes within a `useEffect` hook.

## Bug Description

The `getImageData()` method, used to process pixel data from a captured image, sometimes returns null or incomplete data. This is particularly problematic when the processing happens asynchronously within a `useEffect` hook. The inconsistency makes the bug difficult to reproduce consistently.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Capture an image using the app.
5. Observe the console for errors.  You may need to retry a few times to reproduce the issue.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully handling the asynchronous nature of image data loading and ensuring the data is available before attempting to access it.  Proper error handling and asynchronous operations are crucial to mitigate the issue.
