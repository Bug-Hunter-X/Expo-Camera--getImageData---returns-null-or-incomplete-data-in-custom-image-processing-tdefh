This bug occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Camera` component with custom image processing logic.  The issue arises when attempting to access pixel data from the captured image using methods like `getImageData()` or similar functions within a custom processing function, particularly within a `useEffect` hook after the image is captured.  The data returned might be incomplete, null, or undefined, causing unexpected errors or crashes.
